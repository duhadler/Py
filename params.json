{"name":"mpFormulaPy","tagline":"A library for multiprecision arithmetic in Python","body":"### Welcome to mpFormulaPy.\r\nThe mpFormulaPy library is based on the Python runtime and the mpmath library, both of which implement multiprecision arithmetic.\r\n\r\n### Quick start under Windows.\r\nDownload the ZIP file and unzip it into a directory for which you have write access.\r\nWithin the unzipped directory double-click on mpFormula.bat. This will start the Python Console of the Sharpdevelop IDE.\r\nTo confirm that mpFormulaPy is working, type the following within the Python Console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from mpFormulaPy import *\r\n>>> pi\r\nï»¿mpf('3.141592653589793238462643402')\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\nStill in the Sharpdevelop IDE, click on Tools -> mpFormulaPy Manual, to open the manual in your default pdf viewer.\r\nNavigate to Getting Started - Tutorials, and follow the examples.\r\nYou can copy and paste the Python code of the examples from the manual into the Python Console.\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\nThe manual is also available separately as pdf file: [mpFormulaPy.pdf](https://github.com/mpFormula/Py/raw/master/Manual/mpFormula.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Quick start with Microsoft Excel \r\nTo use the mpFormulaPy functions from within Excel, you need to install the mpFormulaPy addin.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
